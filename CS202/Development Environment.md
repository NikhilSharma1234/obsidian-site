# Development Environment for CS 202

We use C++ 11 for this class, the version of the language that is still in wide use and that is covered in the textbook. C++ 11 is available on any operating system.

> If you have your VM setup from CS 135, you can use it without modification. You can skip to the section on editors as the following sections are for those that do not yet have an environment set up.

## Machine Setup
### Apple Mac
