		- > A **varistor** is an [electronic component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component "Electronic component") with an [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") that varies with the applied voltage.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varistor#cite_note-2) Also known as a **voltage-dependent resistor** (VDR), it has a [nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system "Nonlinear system"), non-[ohmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law#ohmic "Ohm's law") [current–voltage characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current%E2%80%93voltage_characteristic "Current–voltage characteristic") that is similar to that of a [diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode "Diode"). In contrast to a diode however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. Traditionally, varistors were indeed constructed by connecting two rectifiers, such as the copper-oxide or germanium-oxide rectifier in [antiparallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparallel_(electronics) "Antiparallel (electronics)") configuration. At low voltage the varistor has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised. Modern varistors are primarily based on sintered [ceramic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic "Ceramic") metal-oxide materials which exhibit directional behavior only on a microscopic scale. This type is commonly known as the **metal-oxide varistor** (**MOV**).
